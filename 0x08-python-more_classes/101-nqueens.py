"""
The N queens puzzle is the challenge of
placing N non-attacking queens on an NÃ—N
chessboard. This is a program that solves
the N queens problem.

Usage: ./101-nqueens.py N
    N must be a number(at least 4)

backtracking: abandons a candidate as soon as it determines
that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution

queen movement: It can move any number of squares
vertically, horizontally or diagonally
